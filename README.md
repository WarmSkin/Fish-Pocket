# Fish-Pocket

![A screenshot of the game play.]()

*Fish Pocket* is a friendly anglers' app used to track fishing statistics! As an angler, you could log in with a google account, safe and convenient. You could check out the information and fishing regulations for a particular species of fish.(Only NYC marine fishing in the database now) Also, you could add other users as friends to see their fishing process, send messages between each other, and comment on the fish they caught.
Like John D. Williams said "There's no such thing as a bad day when you're fishing." Enjoy your good days!üé£
