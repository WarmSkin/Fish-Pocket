# Fish-Pocket

![A screenshot of the game play.]()

*Fish Pocket* is a friendly angler's app used to track fishing statistics! As an angler, you can log in with your Google account to access all of this app's features, with safety and convenience. You can check out the information and fishing regulations for a particular species of fish. Also, you can add other users as friends to see their growth as an angler, send messages between each other, and congratulate them on the fish they catch.
Like John D. Williams said, "There's no such thing as a bad day when you're fishing."
